# hw01 - DevOps
Development Operations (DevOps) is a branch of software engineering that handles managing resources (such as servers), data, code, builds, networking, and infrastructure with code. The creation of devops and the devops engineer came out of the pain of system administrators of web services. Previous to devops, system administrators would all have their own custom scripts to apply updates, build code, manage virtual machines, etc. It was a wild west with little standardization and extremely low replicability. Slowly out of the pain, devops was created. The big idea of devops is using code to define infrastructure. It facilitates efficient and painless collaboration between developers.

Now, it many not seem like DevOps has much to do with ic design, but this is *open source* ic design. The designs, the tools, the pdk are a collaborative effort and so good devops is necessary to make the work as painless as possible. 

There are two main areas that are needed for our purposes: version control and virtualization for consistent tool performance. We will be using git for version control and docker for consistent tool performance. 


## Q1 - Git Basics
Perform the following simple git tasks exemplory of a standard operation.
- Fork the repository [hw01-q1](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q1)
- Create a new branch from the master named `firstname-last-name-haiku` (inserting your first and last names).
- Checkout the new branch.
- Create a file in the `haiku` directory named `firstname_lastname.md` (inserting your first and last names) and write a haiku inside (5-7-5 sylables). 
- Add the new file
- Commit the changes
- Merge the new branch into the master
- Create a pull request to the repository [hw01-q1](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q1).


## Q2 - Merge Conflict 
Ocasionally when multiple people work on the same repository a merge conflict can occur when two different people work on the same file and git no longer knows which version is the most current. In such a case, merge conflict resolution must be performed. 
- Fork all branches of the repository [hw01-q2](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q2)
- Merge branch `new-feature` into `master`. You will have to resolve the errors. Choose to keep the changes in the `new-feature` branch.
- Create a pull request from your fork's `master` branch to the main [hw01-q2](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q2) repository `master` branch.


## Q3 - Docker Basics
Often times, there are already pre-built Docker images that can be deployed without modification. Pull an image from here [https://hub.docker.com/r/mtseng15/hw01-q3](https://hub.docker.com/r/mtseng15/hw01-q3), run the container, and find the secret message. Enter the secret mesage into Canvas.


## Q4 - Fixing Git Mistakes
Your disgruntled coworker Billy Bob Jones has deleted a key line in a Dockerfile critical to your company's application. Unfortunately, the sabotage wasn't discovered until after it was merged into master and new commits were merged on top. Further, your incompetent coworker Wally didn't properly configure the `.gitignore` so `*.build_products` are comited to the repository.
- Fork the repository [hw01-q4](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q4)
- Find the error and revert (or reset) the changes on `src/some_app.py`. Use either `git revert` or `git reset`; only comment in the commit messages which you chose to use.
- Configure the `.gitignore` to not include `*.build_products` files and remove all `*.build_products` from the git cache. 
- Create a pull request with the fixes to [hw01-q4](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q4)


## Q5 - Docker Image Build
Build a Docker Image (i.e, write a `Dockerfile`) around [hw01-q5-application](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q5-application) to the following specifications:
- Fork the [hw01-q5](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q5) repository. A	`Dockerfile` with a required line has been started for you.
- Based on Alpine 3.17
- Fetches (i.e., `git clone`) the latest commit and builds the application [hw01-q5-application](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q5-application) with the command `make`.
- Must include the line (no modifications) `RUN git clone https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q5-application.git` 
- Final image must be less than `10MB` in size. 
- Command executes the `hw01-q5-application`
- The commandline output should be
    ```
	hello everyone
    this is the hw01-q5-application
    press CTL-C to exit
	```
- Submit a pull request to [hw01-q5](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q5) with your solution.

**HINT:** First build an image that does not meet the size requirement, then split that build into multiple builds which meet the size requirement. 


## Q6 - Docker Compose 
The `docker-compose` file is not configured to properly create the container needed by the application and containerized by the `Dockerfile`:
- Fork the repository [hw01-q6](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q6).
- Diagnose the issue and correct the `docker-compose` file. 
- Write a `Makefile` target called `build-image` that builds the Docker image defined in the `Dockerfile` and tags it `latest`.
- Write a `Makefile` target called `run` that exectues the same operation as `docker-compose`, but without using `docker compose`. I.e., only use `docker container run [OPTIONS]`.
- Submit a pull reqest to the [hw01-q6](https://github.com/UAH-IC-Design-Team/hw01-q6) repository.
